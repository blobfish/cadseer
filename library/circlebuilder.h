/*! @brief class for constructing a circle of points with OpenSceneGraph
 * 
 * Point density can be controlled by ::setSegments or ::setDeviation.
 * Setting by segments will give a consistent mesh regardless
 * of radius. Setting by deviation will give a finer mesh as
 * the radius increases. Deviation calculation uses the radius to 
 * calculate the quantity of points,so the radius should be set
 * before calling setDeviation. Each call to the coversion operator
 * generates a new dynamically allocated osg::Geometry*, so the Circle
 * builder object can be reused. Note that when building a complete circle
 * i.e. setAngularSpan(360) the default, that the last point is excluded.
 * This prevents the duplication of the first and last point. 
 * 
 * Starting place:
 * a value of 16 for setSegments gives an average dense mesh.
 * a value of 0.020 for setDeviation and a radius of 1.0 gives
 * an average dense mesh.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * \code{.h}
 * CircleBuilder builder;
 * builder.setRadius(10.0);
 * builder.setAngularSpan(90.0) //in degrees
 * builder.setDeviation(0.020);
 * osg::Group *group = new osg::Group();
 * group->addChild(builder);
 * \endcode
 * or
 * \code{.h}
 * CircleBuilder builder;
 * builder.setRadius(10.0);
 * builder.setAngularSpan(360.0) //in degrees
 * builder.setSegments(32);
 * std::vector<osg::Vec3d> points = builder;
 * \endcode

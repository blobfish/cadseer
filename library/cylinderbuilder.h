/*! @brief class for constructing a cylinder with OpenSceneGraph
 * 
 * Mesh density can be controlled by ::setIsoLines or ::setDeviation.
 * Setting by Isolines will give a consistent mesh regardless
 * of radius. Setting by deviation will give a finer mesh as
 * the radius increases. Deviation calculation uses the radius to 
 * calculate the quantity of iso lines,so the radius should be set
 * before calling setDeviation. Each call to the coversion operator
 * generates a new dynamically allocated osg::Geometry*, so the cylinder
 * builder object can be reused.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * \code{.h}
 * CylinderBuilder cyBuilder;
 * cyBuilder.setIsoLines(8);
 * cyBuilder.setRadius(2.0);
 * cyBuilder.setHeight(16.0);
 * cyBuilder.setAngularSpanDegrees(360.0);
 * osg::Group *group = new osg::Group();
 * group->addChild(builder);
 * \endcode
